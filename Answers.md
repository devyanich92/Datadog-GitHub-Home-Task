# Datadog-GitHub-Home-Task
The Challenge for -- Support engineer role

I really enjoyed speaking to Alex the other week and apologise for the late submission. After that conversation, I went on holiday for two weeks to see family and friends in India.

While in India, I read through the references provided and established a background on what the task is and how the Datadog software works.

Here is my submission, I hope I’ve covered all the points well, I would love to work for a company like Datadog.

## Level 0 – Installing Vagrant and VirtualBox
 
I followed the steps mentioned in the links provided in “Guide to the agent” to download and install Vagrant and VirtualBox.

I initially tried to manually run the package that I had downloaded from the web for Vagrant, only realising it after that I should probably try having the pre-requisite “VirtualBox”.

After installing both VirtualBox and Vagrant and running the commands in terminal I had the system up and running!

It took a lot of trial-and-error to get the VirtualBox correctly working.

A few errors that I encountered on my way to get Vagrant and VirtualBox working are shown as below:

I overcame these errors by reading various threads and posts on GitHub, I saw a number of posts related to the basic errors that I was getting. I also referred to the reading references provided in the challenge. After watching a couple of videos I realised that I was trying to progress in the wrong direction, and hence I took a break and started with a fresh perspective towards the task.

## Level 1 – Collecting Data

I started this section by downloading the Datadog-Agent via provided link 'https://app.datadoghq.com/account/ settings#agent/ mac'.

Followed the instructions for Agent-installation for Mac OS X as shown below.

After copy pasting the above mentioned code in my terminal and getting numerous “API key invalid” messages, I got curious and decided to change the API key manually as instructed.
