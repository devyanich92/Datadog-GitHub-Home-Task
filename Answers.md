# Datadog-GitHub-Home-Task
The Challenge for -- Support engineer role

I really enjoyed speaking to Alex the other week and apologise for the late submission. After that conversation, I went on holiday for two weeks to see family and friends in India.

While in India, I read through the references provided and established a background on what the task is and how the Datadog software works.

Here is my submission, I hope I’ve covered all the points well, I would love to work for a company like Datadog.

## Level 0 – Installing Vagrant and VirtualBox
 
I followed the steps mentioned in the links provided in “Guide to the agent” to download and install Vagrant and VirtualBox.

I initially tried to manually run the package that I had downloaded from the web for Vagrant, only realising it after that I should probably try having the pre-requisite “VirtualBox”.

After installing both VirtualBox and Vagrant and running the commands in terminal I had the system up and running!

It took a lot of trial-and-error to get the VirtualBox correctly working.

A few errors that I encountered on my way to get Vagrant and VirtualBox working are shown as below:
